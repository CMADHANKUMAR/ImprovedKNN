# Performance enhancement of KNN algorithm using 8-bin hashing and feature weighting
The K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is an instance based learning
method that has been widely used in many pattern classification tasks due to its simplicity,
effectiveness and robustness. But the Standard KNN algorithm fails to work satisfactorily
due to many limitations.This project dealt with improvements of KNN over two major
limitations.First efficiency of KNN classification is improved by eliminating the instances
which are too far away from the query instances.So,the computational time can also be
improved.Second, a novel feature weighting algorithm is introduced based on positive
instances in order to improve the accuracy of classification by reducing the number of
features. Finally,this project gives validation of improvement theories through experimental
results.
